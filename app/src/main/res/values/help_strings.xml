    <string name="help_text">Hash Droid is a free utility to calculate a hash
		from a given text or from a file stored on the device.
		\n\nIn this
		application, the available hash functions are : Adler-32, CRC-32,
		Haval-128, MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, SHA-1, SHA-256,
		SHA-384, SHA-512, Tiger and Whirlpool.
		\nThe calculated hash can be
		copied to the clipboard to be reused
		elsewhere.
		\n\nThe first tab
		enables to calculate the hash of a given string.
		\nThe second tab helps
		you to compute the hash of a file located on the
		internal or external
		memory of your device. The size of the file and
		the last date modified
		are also displayed.
		\nThe last feature helps you to compare the
		calculated hash with another
		given hash but more generally, you can
		compare any hashes by just
		pasting them.
		\n\nA hash (also called
		checksum or digest) is a digital fingerprint,
		uniquely identifying a
		string or a file.
		\nHash functions are often used in cryptography to
		generate strong
		passwords. They are also employed to check the
		integrity of files.\nHash Droid is often used to check an Android ROM before flashing it.\n\nFeel free to send feebacks, comments or
		suggestions about this
		application.\n\nHash Droid is published under
		the GPLv3 (GNU General Public License version 3). Please contact me to
		get the source code.</string>
